======

Kexx2 is a top down scrolling shoot'em up, similar to Raptor and Tyrian.

DISCLAIMER: Most of the code is from 2000-2001 and in an old C++ style (C with
classes). 

The project web page is at: http://www.haeggblad.com/kexx2
and the source code is hosted at: http://github.com/octol/kexx2

Installation from source
------------------------

If you've downloaded any of the source releases (e.g kexx2-1.0.9.tar.gz) then
running the following commands should suffice.

    ./configure                     (check for compilation dependencies)
    make                            (compile)
    make install                    (optional)

Running `make' should produce an executable `kexx2' in the src/ sub directory,
which `make install' then copies to the system (/usr/local/bin/). 

Requirements for building from source
-------------------------------------

To compile Kexx2 you will need a C++11 compiler and the following libraries:

- Boost::filesystem
- Boost::system
- Boost::program_options
- SDL 1.2
- SDL_mixer
- SDL_image


Installation from git repository
-------------------------------

When compiling from the git repository and additional step before `./configure'
is needed to produce the necessary build files. To generate these run

    autoreconf -ivf
