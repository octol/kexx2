Kexx2 is a top down scrolling shoot'em up, similar to Raptor and Tyrian.

DISCLAIMER: Most of the code is from 2000-2001 and in an old C++ style (C with
classes). 

The project web page is at: http://www.haeggblad.com/kexx2
and the source code is hosted at: http://github.com/octol/kexx2

Installation from source
------------------------

If you've downloaded any of the source releases (e.g kexx2-1.0.2.tar.gz) then
running the following commands should suffice.

    ./configure                     (check for compilation dependencies)
    make                            (compile)
    make install                    (optional)

Running `make' should produce an executable `kexx2' in the src/ sub directory,
which `make install' then copies to the system (/usr/local/bin/). Usually you
don't need to run `make install'


Installation from git repository
-------------------------------

When compiling from the git repository and additional step before `./configure'
is needed to produce the necessary build files. To generate these run

    autoreconf -ivf

Configuring path to the game data
---------------------------------

When running the game for the first time you will be prompted to the path to
the game data. If you're running the `kexx2' executable from the src/ sub
directory, then this needs to be set to `../data/'. This configuration is saved
in $HOME/.kexx2rc, in case you need to change this at some later point.
