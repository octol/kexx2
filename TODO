TODO
====

General:
--------
* Variable naming conventions.
* Go over all TODO in code.
* Automatic detection of game data path.
    This requires that we set configuration stuff in .kexx2rc instead of
    kexx2.cfg, due to write permission.
* Make the timer a local object.
* Pass SDLc classes in constructors only? Or Maybe pass references to game
  specific classes in ctor and system class to separate check_input(),
  run_logic(), draw() functions?
* Systematic way of doing dependency injection in e.g Interface.
* Store pointers or objects in lists? e.g Sprites.

Specific:
---------
BuyScreen::runLogic(), playerState argument shadows a class member.
World:World(), seems to do too much in constructor.

libsdlc:
--------
- introduce namespace.
- single header at top level.

Bugs:
-----

- Blinking of ship when hit seems off, is this due to precalc hit surface?
