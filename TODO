TODO
====

High priority:
--------------
- Write settings file "in place" rather than overwrite.
- Make load/init robust.
- Try-catch for Surface/Sprite loading.
- High resolution timer.

Architectural issues:
---------------------
- Systematic way of doing dependency injection in e.g Interface.
- Raw pointer to dependencies?
    - FxManager
- Weapon really need to have object manager in constructor so we don't have
  to pass it as argument everything we use it. Maybe when (if?) we change to
  shorter Manager names it will not be such a hassle?
- Storing player data dynamically instead of C arrays.      <-- important

Low priority:
-------------
- Passing references by const, and make functions const.
- Rename object_manager -> objects ? (applies to all "managers")
- Implement Factory pattern for object creation.
- Go over all TODO in code.
- Remove all empty destructors for leaf node classes.
- Move to using Coord, Color etc objects instead of (x,y,xvel,yvel,r,g,b,a)
- Recheck all UNUSED statements.
- Fix compiler warnings (most already done).

Organisation of system classes:
-------------------------------
- Make the timer a local object.
- We should consider passing a struct of subsystems instead.
- Pass SDLc classes in constructors only? Or Maybe pass references to game
  specific classes in ctor and system class to separate check_input(),
  run_logic(), draw() functions?
  Possibly the other way around.

Feature changes:
----------------

Bugs:
-----
- Hardcoded keycodes instead of using player_state.
