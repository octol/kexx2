TODO
====

General:
--------
* Variable naming conventions.
* Go over all TODO in code.
* Automatic detection of game data path.
    This requires that we set configuration stuff in .kexx2rc instead of
    kexx2.cfg, due to write permission.
* Make the timer a local object.

Specific:
---------
BuyScreen::runLogic(), playerState argument shadows a class member.
World:World(), seems to do too much in constructor.
